# Ruda parser

## Description

Ruda parser is based on the parser developed for the [Ruda programming language](https://github.com/it-2001/Ruda/tree/main). It is a recursive descent parser that uses a grammar file to generate a parser for a given language. The parser is written in Rust and can be used as a library.
